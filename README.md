# !!! file PROJECT_NAME.txt contains project name for script references e.g. 'kfe' (without the quotes)
# !!! file PROJECT_EXT.txt contains the project extension. So if the extended name is kfecom, this file contains 'com' without quotes.

These scripts will add automation, one stroke deployment, backup up of the database etc..

I will document them soon :)


#TODO setup.sh needs to take #name #extension and put them into the project files
